 init does the following:
 (1) Grabs a reference to the alerts manager for creating error alerts
 (2) Creates a sync dispatch group and queue to protect the Facebook friend data
 (3) Calls initStructures to init all other relevant properties
 Returns:  id of the object on success; nil on failure

 initStructures does the following:
 (1) Synchronously initializes the following properties:
  (a) friendDataDict - new with 100 friend initial capacity
  (b) dataSourceIDs - new with 100 friend initial capacity
  (c) nameSearches - new with 20 substring initial capacity
  (d) dataUpdatedSincePull and searchesAreInvalid - YES to indicate dirty data
  (e) filteredDataSourceIndices - nil (indicates no current filter)

 retryAll: does the following:
 (1) Re-initializes all structures (via initStructures)
 (2) Updates the data source lists and asks the UITableViews to reload data
     so that the re-initialization is clearly visible
 (3) Calls checkNetworkAndStartGraphChain: to restart the Graph API request chain

 initiateGraphAPIRequest: does the following:
 (1) Gets a new Graph API request string based on the previous response
 (2) If no more requests, waits for all queued processing to finish,
     updates the data source and table views, and returns
 (3) For a new request, generates the AFNetworking request operation and
     requests the JSON serializer.
 (4) Sets up the success and failure blocks.
   (a) For success, attempts to fill the internal data structures from the response
   (b) For no errors in the data, updates the data source and the table views, and
       launches the next request in the Graph API chain
   (c) With errors in the data, empties the queue and updates the data source and the
       table views, but does NOT continue the Graph API chain
   (d) For failure, if it's an authentication problem, alerts the user and
       sends him back to the log in view controller; if it's another problem
       allows the user to retry or log in again.  Does NOT flush cookies here.
 (5) Launches the request operation.

 (1) Checks for and alerts the user about any data error in the response dict
 (2) On no error with the Graph API data, get the friend data from the response
     and call createFriendsFromFBFriendDataDictList: to create friend objects
     and to update the internal data structures
 (3) On any missing data, alert the user and ask him to accept the missing

 Returns:  YES if friend objects have been created and added to the internal

 (4) Synchronously updates self.friendDataDict with a new WVFacebookFriend
     object with the ID, name, and picture URL string.

 NOTE:  This function currently submits itself asynchronously to

/* searchBarTextChanged: does the following:
 (1) On any change to the search bar filter string, looks for a cached
     index array for the filter string.
 (2) It keeps stripping the filter string until it finds a match with a
     previous search string.
 (3) If it finds a match, and it matches the current filter string, sets
     self.filteredDataSourceIndices to the cached index array.
 (4) If it finds a match, but it doesn't match the current filter string,
     it uses the cached index array as a starting point for another search.
 (5) If it finds no match, it uses the full list of IDs as a starting point
     for another search.
 (6) Generates a new array of filtered indices, updates
     self.filteredDataSourceIndices, and caches the array for future searches.

 (1) If startingArray is not nil, uses it to get the already filtered IDs
     from the full array of IDs.  For each ID, it looks up the friend object,
     retrieves the name, and looks for a substring match.  On success, adds
     the ID to the new list of filtered ID indices.
 (2) If startingArray is nil, uses the full ID list.  Does the same thing
     as (1) with substring matches.
 Returns:  New NSArray with a list of filtered indices into the full ID array.

 NOTE:  This should always be called inside a dispatch_sync block.  Do NOT

     stored in self.friendDataDict

 Returns:  Either the number of elements in the sorted dataSourceIDs array

 Returns:  A decoupled copy of the WVFacebookFriend object for the appropriate
